Meata prompt - Prompt for prompt
I am trying to create a prompt for below requirement, please write it for me.
You own Clothing Essentials Company, a small business targeting middle-income consumers aged 18 to 39. For each season, you plan to offer several new clothing collections based on current trends. 
Your newest collection, the Minimalist Collection, is designed for young adults who identify as minimalists, trying to balance their hectic work schedules with a bustling social life. If you completed the previous activity, you already brainstormed some ideas for T-shirts that will be included in this collection. 
The Minimalist Collection now includes 3 basic shirts in various neutral colors: 
Long-sleeve cotton shirt, offered in white, gray, teal, navy, and forest green
Short-sleeve cotton shirt, offered in white, gray, teal, navy, and forest green
Tank top, offered in white, gray, teal, navy, and forest green
You’ll be prompting a gen AI tool to help you create an image that tells the story of the Minimalist Collection. To do this, consider the following questions:
How will you present the collection so that it will appeal to your audience of busy young adults?
Will you focus on a couple of key items, or attempt to display the entire collection?
What lighting or background colors will help the collection have the most appeal?
For reference, here are a few examples of clothing collection images: (Note: these are AI-generated images. Results are for illustrative purposes and may vary.)

Third version - 
Create a high-quality, aesthetically pleasing image to showcase the Minimalist Collection by Clothing Essentials, a brand targeting middle-income consumers aged 18 to 39. The collection includes three essential pieces for young minimalists balancing demanding work schedules and vibrant social lives: a long-sleeve cotton shirt, a short-sleeve cotton shirt, and a tank top—all available in white, gray, teal, navy, and forest green.
The image should:
Present the collection in a clean, minimal layout, with soft, natural lighting and a neutral or monochrome background (e.g., warm gray or light beige) that enhances the simplicity and elegance of the clothes.
Feature a diverse group of young adults (ages 20–35) in real-life settings: one in a stylish café with friends (tank top), one in a modern office (long-sleeve), and one relaxing outdoors or at home (short-sleeve).
Emphasize the versatility and comfort of the clothing—suitable for both work and weekend.
Incorporate light lifestyle elements (e.g., a laptop, coffee cup, headphones) to show how seamlessly these basics fit into a minimalist lifestyle.
Use a modern, editorial photography style—think clean lines, neutral tones, and natural body poses.
Avoid clutter and loud colors. Focus on conveying simplicity, flexibility, and effortless style.

Fourth version
I own a small clothing business called Clothing Essentials Company, targeting middle-income consumers aged 18 to 30. I’m developing a new line called the Millennials Collection, scheduled to launch for the fall season on November 1st. Today is April 24th, and I need help creating a detailed 6-month production and launch plan for this collection, taking the following constraints into account:
My lead designer will be on leave from June 16 to July 20, so I’ll need to schedule key design decisions and reviews outside of that window.
Due to global shipping delays, fabric orders (including samples) will take six weeks instead of two.
My current manufacturer is no longer cost-effective, so I need to research and secure a new manufacturer offering better pricing.
The output should include:
A month-by-month action plan from March to September
Suggestions for prioritizing tasks around the designer’s availability
Tips for managing fabric order timelines
A timeline for identifying, vetting, and onboarding a new manufacturer
Contingency planning advice to keep the launch on track
Please format the output clearly and practically in table format, suitable for sharing with my team in a kickoff meeting.
