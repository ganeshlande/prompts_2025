I am working on developing a [project_name] using [programming_language]. I am in need of a [code_generation_tool] that can assist me in automating the coding process. The tool should provide [number_of_templates] different templates that are suitable for [project_requirement]. Additionally, it should suggest the most appropriate [framework_library] for the project. Can you suggest a code generation tool that meets these requirements?
