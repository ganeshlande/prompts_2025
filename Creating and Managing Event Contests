As an event planner, I need to create and manage a contest for my upcoming [event_name] event. The theme of the event is [theme_name] and the audience consists of [target_audience]. 
Can you generate [number_of_contest] contest ideas that are relevant to the event theme and audience? Additionally, can you provide a submission and voting process that can be easily managed online?
